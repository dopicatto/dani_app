Monitoring
To effectively monitor the application, a combination of logging, metrics collection, and alerting is essential. Here's a brief explanation of the monitoring strategy and the system to use:

Monitoring Strategy:
Logging: Capture application logs to understand errors, warnings, and general operational messages.

Metrics Collection: Collect metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, request count, response time, and error rates.

Alerting: Set up alerts to notify when metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

System for Monitoring:

Azure Monitor: Leverage Azure Monitor to collect, analyze, and act on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It includes:

Azure Log Analytics: To collect and analyze log data.
Azure Application Insights: To monitor live applications and automatically detect performance anomalies.
Azure Alerts: To set up and configure alerts based on collected metrics and logs.
